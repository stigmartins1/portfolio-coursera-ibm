          <p>
            I have several years experience with IT, mainly implementation, operation and technical support.

            Print Management And Mobility Suite towards Xerox Multifunction Devices, as well as document
            scanning with Nuance AutoStore where a predefined workflow provides automated retrieval and
            dynamic metadata processing from OCR, databases and Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems,
            simplifying and streamlining digital document and information management. Continuously working
            on increasing my skills in programming and web technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years I've also worked a lot with installing, configuring, troubleshooting and replacing
            / upgrading many types of hardware components (MB, CPU, RAM, HDD / SSD, GPU, PSU), firmware
            (BIOS / EFI, RAID) configuration, preparation and administration of Microsoft server and client OS
            (Windows 2016, 2012 / R2, 2008 / R2, 2003, 10, 8 / 8.1, 7, Vista, XP), Active Directory, LAN, WLAN,
            WAN, TCP/IP v4, DNS, DHCP , NTFS, Group Policy, PowerShell, Virtualization (mainly Hyper-V). Have

            expert in the field.
